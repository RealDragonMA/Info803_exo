# if you are taking the exam

1 - Please Fork the repo, work on your own fork. (rememeber to delete it in a few weeks, when your recrutement process is over)
2 - Difficulty is increasing : Solve test one by one, we would like to see your method and not the perfect solution magically jump out of the hat.
3 - Do commit & push each time a new test becomes green.
4 - Keep in mind that this is a session to asses your coding skills : how you are doing stuff is as important as passing all the tests.

One can alway make mistakes... but this kata has been run litteraly hundreds of times. if something feels odd it's very unlikely that it would be coming from the exercise
You're not allowed to change the tests.

Good luck :D

Guillaume.
